# SwingSet3 #

SwingSet3 application, forked from https://github.com/sjas/swingset3 (originally taken from the SVN repository at https://java.net/projects/swingset3), ready for Eclipse.

## Purpose ##

This application will be used to evaluate various Swing-compatible capture and replay tools. Sources will change over time in order to simulate the software development process.

Commits until `999b897` (Nov 10, 2015) do not include these changes. Hence, this revision can be used to have a Eclipse-ready SVN clone of the original SwingSet3.
